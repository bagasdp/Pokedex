Hello to Recruiter Of tokopedia, my name is bagas dwi prasetyo

before you guys seeing my project i want to say thank you so much for giving me this big opportunity to have a test for software enginer at tokopedia.
I'm so happy but i didn't realize that the test would be this hard, i'm really sorry if my code (project) is not as recruiter expected.
Overall it was my mistake for didn't taking this test seriously and again thanks for reviewing my project
